# Changelog

## 27 November 2018

| Packages | Version | Changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| React / Inferno / Preact | 3.0.0 | :rocket: **BREAKING CHANGES**: we've simplified Refract API, to allow for `handler` to be optional [(#124)](https://github.com/fanduel-oss/refract/pull/124)<br>:fire: React packages now have a `useRefract` hook [(#123)](https://github.com/fanduel-oss/refract/pull/123) |

#### API simplification (BREAKING CHANGES)

`withEffects` and `aperture` have now a simplified "flattened" API. `handler`, `errorHandler` and `Context` are entirely optional in `withEffects` (note that `Context` is only for React 16.6.0 and above). In addition `aperture` is now a simple function:

```js
const aperture = (component, initialProps, initialContext) => {
    /** Return a stream **/
}

const MyContainerComponent = withEffects(
    aperture,
    { hander, errorHander, Context }
)(MyBaseComponent)
```

#### Hook

In addition, a `useRefract` hook has been introduced. It is very similar to `withEffects`:
- Instead of observing `props`, it can observe `data` passed to it. `data` can be anything: props, context, state.
- `useRefract` doesn't have the ability to observe functions being called
- It has only one built-in effect called `toRender`, which enables to return data to your component

```js
const aperture = (component, initialData) => {
    /** Return a stream **/
}

function MyComponent(props) {
    const context = useContext(MyContext)
    const data = {
        ...props,
        ...context
    }
    const returnedData = useRefract(aperture, data)
}
```

# Observing Anything

Your `aperture` receives all initial props passed to your component. By passing observable data sources as props, you can observe anything you wish and trigger side-effects in response.

This is a good way to inject any observable data source via `initialProps` can therefore be used to trigger effects. What you have to do is to pass the props you need to `withEffects`: see [Dependency injection](./dependency-injection.md)

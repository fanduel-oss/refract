# Testing

Refract's API has been designed so that each facet (`aperture`, `handler`, `errorHandler`) is pure, which means they can be tested in isolation.

How you test the internals of your aperture depends on which streaming library you choose, as they all offer different testing approaches. We would like to compile a list of useful links on testing for each of the streaming libraries integrated with Refract, so if you encounter any please either open a PR or get in touch via [our Discord channel](https://discord.gg/fqk86GH)!

# Pushing to props

By now, you should have a better understanding of what Refract does:

*   It allows you to observe data sources ([React](./observing-react.md), [redux](./observing-redux), [anything else](./observing-anything.md))
*   It allows you to push data to an effect handler (see [handling effects](./handling-effects.md))

Refract has three built-in effect handlers, to:

*   Pass additional props to the child it wraps
*   Replace props
*   Render components

This section focuses on adding and replacing props, and its applications.

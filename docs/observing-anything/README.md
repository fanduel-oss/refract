 # Observing anything

`effectFactory` is passed initial props (`initialProps`): by passing observable data sources as props, they can be used to trigger side-effects.

it is a good way to inject any observable data source in `initialProps` can therefore be used to trigger effects. What you have to do is to pass the props you need to `withEffects`: see [Dependency injection](./dependency-injection.md)

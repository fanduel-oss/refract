## Visit time

This examples renders a stopwatch counting the time a user spends on a page while being online.

#### Aperture

Two sources observed:

*   The visibility status of the page (See [page visibility API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Page_Visibility_API)
*   The online status of the navigator (See [online and offline events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigatorOnLine/Online_and_offline_events)

Every time the page becomes visible and online, the stopwatch resumes. If the page becomes either offline or hidden, the stopwatch pauses.

#### Handler

The Refract `handler` handles `pause`, `resume` and `tick` effects to track the total time spent on the page and set it in state. It handles `Date.now()` impure calls.

#### Result

The end result is a stopwatch counting the number of milliseconds spent on the page when visible and online. To play with it you can:

*   switch between tabs, and you'll notice the counter hasn't moved while the example tab was hidden
*   toggle your navigator online status (can be done via devtools)

This basic example renders a single text input which prompts for a GitHub username; the current `username` of this input is stored in React component state.

#### Aperture

Only one source is observed:

-   The `username` prop.

Every time the input's `username` changes, the new username is passed to the stream. Any blank strings are filtered from the stream, and then the usernames are debounced for one second.

After debouncing, a fetch request is made and resolved; the response of this request is output as an effect with a type of `USER_DATA_RECEIVE`.

#### Handler

The Refract `handler` sets the payload of any effect with a type of `USER_DATA_RECEIVE` into state, ready to be displayed in the UI.

#### Result

The end result is a debounced fetch request based on input's current value, with the results rendered to the UI.

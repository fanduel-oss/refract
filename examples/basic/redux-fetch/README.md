## Redux Fetch

This basic example renders a single text input which prompts for a GitHub username. When the user submits the form (either by clicking the button or pressing return), it dispatches a plain action to Redux.

Inside the Refract `aperture`, two observables are observed: the `USER_REQUEST` action, and the `getUsers`  selector. Every time an action with the type `USER_REQUEST` is dispatched to the store, it is passed to the stream; every time the `users` object in the redux store changes, it is also passed to the stream.

These two streams are combined into one `combined$` - each time anything is sent to either stream, this new stream emits a new tuple containing the most recent value from _both_ source streams.

This combined stream is piped through various methods in two separate control flows: requests for users whose data is not yet in redux are mapped to a fetch request, with error handling built in; requests for users whose data _is_ already in the store are mapped to a `selectUser` action.

The Refract `handler` inspects the type of each effect, and causes different effects for different action types. If the effect is an error, it logs the effect; if the effect is either a `USER_RECEIVE` or a `USER_SELECT` effect, it is dispatched to the store.

The end result is a form with some complex conditional, asynchronous logic built in an easily maintainable way.
